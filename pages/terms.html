                Overview.</strong><br>These Terms of Use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) set forth a legally binding agreement
            between you and Rabbit 3 Times LLC d/b/a Play (“<strong>Company</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”,
            “<strong>our</strong>”, or “<strong>us</strong>”), and govern your use of any online service location that posts
            a link to these Terms, and all features, content, and other services that we own, control and make available
            through such online service location, including, but not limited to, <a
                href="http://www.createwithplay.com">www.createwithplay.com</a> (collectively, the
            “<strong>Service</strong>”). &nbsp;<br>‍<br>In some instances, both these Terms and separate terms elsewhere on
            the Service will apply to your use of the Service (“<strong>Additional Terms</strong>”). To the extent there is
            a conflict between these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless
            they expressly state otherwise.<br>‍<br>By using the Service, you agree to these Terms, and consent to our
            collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in our <a
                href="http://www.createwithplay.com/privacy"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>.</a> If you do not agree and
            consent, discontinue use of the Service. &nbsp;<br>‍<br><strong>2. Service Use.</strong><br><strong>A.
                Content.</strong><br>The Service contains: (i) materials and other items relating to Company and its
            products and services, and similar items from our licensors and other third parties, including all layout,

            marks, and trade identities of various parties, including those of Company; and (iii) other forms of
            intellectual property (all of the foregoing, collectively “<strong>Content</strong>”). All right, title, and
            interest in and to the Service and the Content is the property of Company or our licensors or certain other
            third parties, and is protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark, trade dress, patent and/or other

            &nbsp;<br>‍<br><strong>B. Limited License.</strong><br>Subject to your strict compliance with these Terms and
            any applicable Additional Terms, Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable,
            personal, and non-transferable license to download, display, view, use, and play the Content on a personal
            computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, or other internet-enabled device (each, a
            “<strong>Device</strong>”), in each case for your personal, non-commercial use only. The foregoing limited
            license (i) does not give you any ownership of, or any other intellectual property interest in, any Content, and
            (ii) may be suspended or terminated for any reason, in Company’s sole discretion, and without advance notice or
            liability. Your unauthorized use of the Content may violate copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity,
            communications, and other laws, and any such use may result in your personal liability, including potential
            criminal liability. &nbsp;<br>‍<br><strong>C. Accounts.</strong><br>Certain features of the Service may require

            third party arising from your failure to comply with any of the foregoing obligations. &nbsp;<br>‍<br><strong>D.
                Restrictions.</strong><br>You may not use the Service unless you are at least thirteen (13) years old.
            <br>You may not: (i) use the Service or Content for any political or commercial purpose; (ii) engage in any
            activity in connection with the Service or Content that is unlawful, harmful, offensive, sexually explicit,
            obscene, violent, threatening, harassing, abusive, falsely representative of your persona, invasive of someone
            else’s privacy, or otherwise objectionable to Company; (iii) harvest any information from the Service or
            Content; (iv) reverse engineer or modify the Service or Content; (v) interfere with the proper operation of or
            any security measure used by the Service or Content; (vi) infringe any intellectual property or other right of
            any third party; (vii) use the Service or Content in a manner that suggests an unauthorized association or is
            beyond the scope of the limited license granted to you; or (viii) otherwise violate these Terms or any
            applicable Additional Terms. &nbsp;<br>‍<br>You agree to comply with all local, state, federal, national,
            foreign, supranational, and international laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations, treaties, directives, and
            agreements that apply to your use of the Service and Content. &nbsp;<br>‍<br><strong>E. Availability.
            </strong><br>Company may suspend or terminate the availability of the Service and Content, in whole or in part,
            to any individual user or all users, for any reason, in Company’s sole discretion, and without advance notice or
            liability. Upon suspension or termination of your access to the Service, or upon notice from Company, all rights
            granted to you under these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that
            you will immediately discontinue use of the Service and Content. <br>‍<br><strong>F. Reservation of
                Rights.</strong><br>All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Company and its licensors and
            other third parties. No right or license may be construed, under any legal theory, by implication, estoppel,
            industry custom, or otherwise. Any unauthorized use of the Content or Service for any purpose is
            prohibited.<br>‍<br><strong>3. Subscriptions and Products.</strong><br>Certain areas of the Service require
            payment before you can access them (“<strong>Subscriptions</strong>”). For example, you may need to subscribe in
            order to access certain video content on our Service. Subscriptions can be purchased by paying a monthly
            subscription fee. When you register for a Subscription, you get access to the premium areas of our Service.
            SUBSCRIPTIONS CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND COMPANY
            WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID. Your payment will automatically renew at the end of the
            subscription period, unless you cancel your Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the
            current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current
            subscription period. Company may change the price for the Subscriptions, from time to time, by posting the new
            price on its Service. Price changes for Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription
            period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing
            to use the Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the
            right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Service prior to the price change going into effect. Please
            therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully. Additional Terms may
            apply.<br>‍<br>From time to time, we may offer trials of Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or
            at a reduced rate (a “<strong>Trial</strong>”). We will require you to provide your payment information to start
            the Trial. UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR TRIAL THROUGH YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PAGE BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL, WE WILL
            AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOU FOR A SUBSCRIPTION ON THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE TRIAL, ON A RECURRING
            MONTHLY BASIS. Your Subscription will be subject to the terms set forth in this Section.<br>‍<br>We do our best
            to describe every product or service offered on our Service as accurately as possible. However, we are human,
            and therefore we do not warrant that product specifications, pricing, or other content on the Service is
            complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or
            specifications, Company shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in its sole discretion. If we
            charged your credit card or other account prior to our cancellation, we will issue a credit to your account in
            the amount of the charge. Additional Terms may apply. If a product or service you purchased from Company is not
            as described, your sole remedy is to cancel the purchase and receive a credit for the purchase price.
            &nbsp;<br>‍<br>All physical products purchased from the Service are made pursuant to a shipment contract.
            &nbsp;This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon delivery to the
            carrier.<br>‍<br>For any purchases made through third party platform providers, such as Apple, Amazon, Roku, or
            Google, please contact their customer support. Their terms, conditions and policies, and not ours, apply and we
            do not handle returns or refund requests for purchases through those third party platform
            providers.<br>‍<br><strong>4. Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties.</strong><br>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED
            TO YOU ON AN "AS IS," "AS AVAILABLE," AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" BASIS. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS,
            DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "COMPANY PARTIES") MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS,
            WARRANTIES OR ENDORSEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER AS TO THE CONTENT OR OTHER SERVICES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR
            IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, OR ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE,
            INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
            QUIET ENJOYMENT AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT
            THAT YOUR ACTIVITIES ARE LAWFUL IN EVERY JURISDICTION WHERE YOU ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.
            <br>‍<br>NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THESE DISCLAIMERS DO NOT EXCLUDE ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, STATUTORY
            CONSUMER RIGHTS, DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL INJURY OR RESULTING FROM COMPANY INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,
            RECKLESSNESS, FRAUD, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.<br>‍<br><strong>5. Limitations of Our Liability.</strong><br>TO THE
            MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR
            INJURY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
            LOSSES OR DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR SYSTEM FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OR LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, BUSINESS OR
            GOOD-WILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH (A) THE SERVICE, (B) THESE TERMS OR (C) YOUR MISUSE OF THE
            SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE. THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION SHALL
            APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER THE ASSERTED LIABILITY OR DAMAGES ARE BASED ON CONTRACT,
            INDEMNIFICATION, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY. <br>NOTWITHSTANDING THE
            FOREGOING, THESE DISCLAIMERS HEREIN DO NOT EXCLUDE ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS,
            DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL INJURY OR RESULTING FROM COMPANY INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, RECKLESSNESS, FRAUD,
            OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.<br>‍<br><strong>6. Indemnification.</strong><br>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold
            harmless the Company Parties from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and
            expenses (including, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any of the
            following: (i) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms; (ii) your misuse of the Service; (iii) your
            violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental or
            quasi-governmental authorities; (iv) your violation of the rights of any third party, including any intellectual
            property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (v) your use of a Third Party Service; or
            (vi) any misrepresentation made by you. Company reserves the right to assume, at your expense, the exclusive
            defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you. You agree to cooperate with Company’s
            defense of any claim. You will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of
            Company.<br>‍<br>This provision does not require you to indemnify us for any unconscionable commercial practice
            by us or for our fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of
            any material fact in connection with the Service.<br>‍<br><strong>7. Customer Support.</strong> <br>If you have

                href="mailto:contact@createwithplay.com"><strong>here</strong></a>. &nbsp;You acknowledge that the provision

            electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.<br>‍<br><strong>8. Third
                Party Services.</strong> Our Service contains content from and hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms,
            and services operated and owned by third parties (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”). We may also
            integrate third party technologies into our Service and host our content on Third Party Services. These Third
            Party Services are not owned, controlled, or operated by us, and you acknowledge and agree that we are not
            responsible or liable for the information, content, products, technologies, or services on or available from
            such Third Party Services, or for the results to be obtained from using them. If you choose to access, transact
            with, or otherwise interact with any such Third Party Services, you do so at your own risk. For more information
            on Third Party Services, see our <a href="http://www.createwithplay.com/privacy"><strong>Privacy
                    Policy</strong>.<br><br></a><strong>9. Service Features.</strong> <br><strong>A. Communications.
            </strong><br>E-mails: You can opt-out of receiving certain promotional e-mails from us at any time by following
            the instructions as provided in e-mails to click on the unsubscribe link, or contacting us <a
                href="mailto:contact@createwithplay.com"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> </strong>with the word
            UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject field of the e-mail. Your opt-out will not affect non-promotional e-mails, such as
            those about your account, transactions, servicing, or Company’s ongoing business relations.<br>Please note that
            any opt-out by you is limited to the e-mail address used and will not affect subsequent
            subscriptions.<br>‍<br><strong>10. Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes and Choice of Law.</strong>
            <br><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR
                RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. &nbsp;IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR
                MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.<br>‍</strong><br><strong>A. We Both Agree to
                Arbitrate. </strong><br>You and Company agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final
            and binding arbitration, except to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Company’s
            intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights). &nbsp;Under
            such circumstances Company may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of
            the Service, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent
            rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described herein.
            <br>‍<br><strong>B. What is Arbitration.</strong><br>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and
            seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral
            arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this
            arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining
            arbitration terms shall be enforced. <br><strong><br>C. Arbitration Procedures.</strong><br>The Federal
            Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration
            shall be initiated through JAMS. &nbsp;Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these
            Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined
            Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator. &nbsp;If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and
            the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in this Terms will govern. The JAMS Rules and
            instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at <a
                href="http://www.jamsadr.com">http://www.jamsadr.com</a> or 1-800-352-5267. &nbsp;To initiate arbitration,
            you or Company must do the following things:<br>‍<br>(1) &nbsp; &nbsp;Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand
            must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of
            a demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com. <br>‍<br>(2) &nbsp; &nbsp;Send three copies of the demand for
            Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero
            Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111.<br>‍<br>(3) &nbsp; &nbsp;Send one copy of the demand for
            Arbitration to the other party.<br>‍<br>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
            governed by the JAMS Rules. If traveling to New York is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by
            phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their
            own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in
            that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees).
            Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without
            regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and
            relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
            entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>‍<br><strong>D. Authority of Arbitrator.</strong><br>The
            arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company, and the dispute will not be
            consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the
            authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to
            award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
            applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement
            of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the
            calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis
            that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and
            Company.<br>‍<br><strong>E. Waiver of Class Actions.</strong><br>You waive any right to pursue an action on a
            class-wide basis against us and may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a
            claim against us as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class
            arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not
            allowed.<br>‍<br><strong>F. Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong><br>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND
            STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims
            and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient
            and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event
            any litigation should arise between you and Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce
            an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the
            dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY
            IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.<br>‍<br><strong>G. Choice of Law/Forum
                Selection.</strong><br>In any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to
            litigate in court, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
            New York, excluding its conflict of law rules. You further expressly consent and agree to submit to the
            exclusive jurisdiction and venue of a court of competent jurisdiction located in New York,
            NY.<br>‍<br><strong>11. Waiver of Injunctive or other Equitable Relief.</strong><br>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
            PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF
            ANY KIND, SUCH AS ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION
            OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, SUBMISSIONS, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED,
            USED OR CONTROLLED BY COMPANY OR A LICENSOR OF COMPANY.<br>‍<br><strong>12. Updates to Terms.</strong><br>We
            reserve the right, at any time in our sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of these Terms and any
            applicable Additional Terms, without prior notice. You agree that we may notify you of any updated Terms and any
            applicable Additional Terms by posting them on the Service so that they are accessible via a link from the home
            page, and/or to send you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us. All such changes are effective
            immediately when we post them, or such later date as may be specified in the notice of updated Terms and any
