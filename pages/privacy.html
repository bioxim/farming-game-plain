                    <p><em>Deletion</em></p>
                    <p>You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you.
                        Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your
                        Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have
                        requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion
                        request. <br>‍</p>
                    <p><em>Exercising Your Rights</em></p>
                    <p>To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a
                        request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about
                        whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow
                        us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be
                        considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We
                        will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your
                        request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>
                    <p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee
                        for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly
                        unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and
                        explain that decision before completing your request.</p>
                    <p>You may submit a Valid Request &nbsp;by emailing us at: <a
                            href="mailto:support@createwithplay.com">support@createwithplay.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do
                        this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your
                        behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they
                        make a request on your behalf.<br>‍</p>
                    <p><em>Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In</em></p>
                    <p>We will not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12 months. To our knowledge,
                        we do not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.</p>

                    <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you
                        our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods
                        and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of
                        our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices,
                        rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal

                        due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to
